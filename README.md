This is the code repo for *Facial Details Synthesis From Single Input Image*. [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10873)] [[Supplemental Material](https://github.com/apchenstu/Facial_Details_Synthesis/blob/master/src/imgs/Supplemental_Material.pdf)]

This repository consists of 5 individual parts: *DFDN*, *emotionNet*, *landmarkDetector*, *proxyEstimator* and *faceRender*. 

 - *DFDN* is used to estimate displacement map, and its network architecture is based on junyanz's [pix2pix](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix)
 - For *landmarkDetector* and FACS-based expression detector (you can choose between this and *emotionNet*), we use a simplified version of [openFace](https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace)
 - [*proxyEstimator*](https://github.com/LansburyCH/eos-expression-aware-proxy/tree/d8d4c7dfec4784c4f02dc8299bb73b80f81a6110) is used to generate proxy mesh using expression/emotion prior. It is modified based on [patrikhuber](https://github.com/patrikhuber)'s fantastic work [eos](https://github.com/patrikhuber/eos)
 - [*faceRender*](https://github.com/gg-z/face_rendering/tree/41b5ea992246dc02768cde715dd39873f0411e13) is used for interactive rendering

We would like to thank each of the related projects for their great work.



# Facial Details Synthesis
### [Anpei Chen](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Chen%2C+A), [Zhang Chen](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Chen%2C+Z), [Guli Zhang](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Zhang%2C+G), [Ziheng Zhang](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Zhang%2C+Z), [Kenny Mitchell](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Mitchell%2C+K), [Jingyi Yu](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Yu%2C+J)

We present a single-image 3D face synthesis technique that can handle challenging facial expressions while recovering fine geometric details. Our technique employs expression analysis for proxy face geometry generation and combines supervised and unsupervised learning for facial detail synthesis. On proxy generation, we conduct emotion prediction to determine a new expression-informed proxy. On detail synthesis, we present a Deep Facial Detail Net (DFDN) based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Net (CGAN) that employs both geometry and appearance loss functions. For geometry, we capture 366 high-quality 3D scans from 122 different subjects under 3 facial expressions. For appearance, we use additional 163K in-the-wild face images and apply image-based rendering to accommodate lighting variations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can produce high-quality 3D faces with realistic details under challenging facial expressions.

## Usage

* For proxy estimation, 

  ```
  python proxyPredictor.py -i path/to/input/image -o path/to/output/folder [--FAC 1][--emotion 1]
  ```
  
  - For batch processing, you can set `-i` to a image folder.

  - For prior features, you can optional choose one of those two priors: 
      FACS-based expression prior, `--FAC 1`, 
      emotion prior, `--emotion 1`.

  example: `python proxyPredictor.py -i ./samples/proxy -o ./results`

- For facial details estimation,

  ```
  python facialDetails.py -i path/to/input/image -o path/to/output/folder
  ```
  
  example: 
  
  `python facialDetails.py -i ./samples/details/019615.jpg -o ./results`
  
  `python facialDetails.py -i ./samples/details -o ./results`


  
* note: we highly suggest you crop input image to a square size.

## Q & A

  1. Proxy result is different with showing in the paper?
  
     It's because the released version are using a lower resolution input and a different expression dictionary, which are more robust in general case. Please try [this](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AjyDwSVHuwr8o2zZaVlNKH9iwIC3?e=4YHctg) if you want to obtain similar results as in the paper.
